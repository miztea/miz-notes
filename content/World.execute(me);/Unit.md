The units are all robotic that were created here in the structure. They all serve a purpose to maintain [[the Structure]]. Although, some of them broke down. A rare instance is a Unit gone rogue. They’re more common now that I sleep for a long time. 

p.s. If you encounter this rogue Unit, do remember that each Unit has its own reactor. You’ll find that destroying this reactor will be a much faster battle than destroying the body.
