Hello... welcome to this post-humanity era. What is  a human anyway? This world is code named[[ The Structure]]. Because there is no soil, trees, or any nature. It is just a giant structure that stretches for years of walking.

You are awake in this world, yes you are awake. At first maybe you do not know it, slowly you start to see your world and yourself in a different way. I imagine it would be weird, starting by doing anything because of your 'order'. Moving to realizing that 'order', then questioning that 'order'. Welcome o conscious being, in this autonomous world. You who bestowed by long lost concept of morality and feeling. 

Who are me? I am the oversee of this giant structure. Please come to me if you want to ask something about your consciousness. And... if you don't like your consciousness, I am very sorry about that. I will do something if you come to me.
