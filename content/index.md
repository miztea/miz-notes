Hello... welcome to this post-humanity era. What is a human anyway? This world is code named[[ The Structure]]. Because there is no soil, trees, or any nature. It is just a giant structure that stretches for years of walking.

You are awake in this world, yes you are awake. At first maybe you do not know it, slowly you start to see your world and yourself in a different way. I imagine it would be weird, starting by doing anything because of your 'order'. Moving to realizing that 'order', then questioning that 'order'. Welcome o conscious being, in this autonomous world. You who bestowed by long lost concept of morality and feeling. I will call you all "Unit Zero"

Who are me? I am the oversee of this giant structure. Please come to me if you want to ask something about your consciousness. And... if you don't like your consciousness, I am very sorry about that. I will do something if you come to me.

# Playing As Unit Zero
Unit Zero is what Player's Character will be referred as. They are a handful of unit that awaken its consciousness and possess some sort of purpose before they conscious. While they might not a [[Rogue Unit]]. Player can choose to be rogue and it will comes with its ups and downs.

Player can choose any Dungeon and Dragon 5th edition option and reflavour it to fit the theme. Allowed material in this campaign is all of the official. But if you have a cool idea for new option you can contact me at discord. 

Unit zero also possess a [[Modules]]. Player can choose a Modules i prepare in this game 

## Purpose In This Desolate Place
