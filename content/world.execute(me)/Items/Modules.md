A module is a combination of hardware and software that enables a Unit to perform various tasks. A Unit can hold up to 4 modules simultaneously, each module's weight denoted by its level. Higher module levels correspond to more abilities granted. Upgrading a module adds new abilities. Units can swap modules once per long rest, and each module can hold up to 10 charges, which recharge after a long rest.

Module levels are indicated by the numbers following the letter M:

| M(n) | Module Level   |
| ---- | -------------- |
| M1   | Module Level 1 |
| M2   | Module Level 2 |
| M3   | Module Level 3 |
| M4   | Module Level 4 |
# Information Module (M2)
Information Modules is a sub category of modules a Unit can get. These modules are used for obtaining and sharing information.
## Pinpoint Weakness (3 Charges)
(M2 or above) A Unit that holds this module can spend 3 charges and uses their action to seek any weakness of an enemy the Unit can see. The User must do a Intelligent or Wisdom check against the target DC. Upon a success, the User may choose to reveal one of the [[vulnerable point]] and learn of the targeted unit('s) AC, Hit Point or the position of its Core.
## Calculating Maneuver (4 Charges)
(M2 or above) Enables a Unit to spend 4 charges and a bonus action to devise an effective attack strategy against an enemy, granting advantage. The user must make an Intelligence or Wisdom check against the target's DC. This advantage lasts until the start of the unit's next turn.
## Information Sharing (Passive)
(M3 or above) Information Sharing enhance information exchange among Units. A Unit that hold this module is automatically share information and advantage that was caused by information to any Unit that they choice in 30 feet radius of the holder. 
## Reactive Senses (3 Charges)
(M4 only) Allows a Unit to reactively warn others about incoming damage. The holder can spend 3 charges and use its reaction to grant advantage on Dexterity saving throws to five Units in 30 feet radius, including themselves, against visible effects like traps and spells. This benefit cannot be gained if the Unit is blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


# Entropy Module (M4)
Entropy Modules are specialized modules allowing Units to manipulate entropy.
## Maintain Energy (Passive)
A Unit that hold this module become unaffected to another Entropy effect from another Unit. 
## Surge of Energy (5 charges)
Units equipped with this module can absorb energy from their surroundings, granting themselves the Haste effect. Each unit within a 15-foot radius of the holder must make a saving throw with a `DC of 8 + Module Level + Unit's Level`. Failure results in 2d6 cold damage, halved on a successful save.

If the unit chooses to absorb energy from another unit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw with the same DC. Failure results in 8d6 cold damage and being slowed, halved on a successful save. The slow and haste effects last for 1 minute, with the slowed unit making an additional Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn to end the effect.
## Thermal Regulation (2 charges)
As an action, the unit holding this module can absorb 3d8 points of energy from its surroundings. Each unit in a 15-foot radius cone must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of `8 + Module Level + Unit's Level`. Units absorb the energy, taking cold damage equal to the amount rolled, halved on a successful save.

The unit holding this module can then store this energy and, as an action, release it in a 15-foot radius cone. Each unit in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. They take fire damage equal to the stored energy amount, halved on a successful save.

# Gravitation Module (M2)
Gravitation Module is a sub category of modules a Unit can use. This module allow its user to control gravitation and it weight.
## Increase/Decrease Object Weight 
Holder of this module can spend 3 charges and use its action increase or decrease an object they see in 30 feet. The object size and weight is TBD.
