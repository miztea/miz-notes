Module is a set of hardware and software that a Unit can use to do various thing. Unit can only hold _up to_ 4 slot of modules at a time. Each of the module's weight is indicated by their level. The level in a module  also indicate the number of  abilities it grants. When a modules gets upgraded, it gain new ability . A Unit can change their module once per long rest. A module can only hold 10 charges and the charges it has will recharge after long rest.

 A module's level is indicated using the numbers written after the letter M. Example:

| M(n) | Module Level   |
| ---- | -------------- |
| M1   | Module Level 1 |
| M2   | Module Level 2 |
| M3   | Module Level 3 |
| M4   | Module Level 4 |
# Information Module (M2)
Information Modules is a sub category of modules a Unit can get. These modules are used for obtaining and sharing information.
## Pinpoint Weakness (3 Charges)
(M2 or above) A Unit that holds this module can spend 3 charges and uses their action to seek any weakness of an enemy the Unit can see. The User must do a Intelligent or Wisdom check against the target DC. Upon a success, the User may choose to reveal one of the [[vulnerable point]] and learn of the targeted unit('s) AC, Hit Point or the position of its Core.
## Calculating Maneuver (4 Charges)
(M2 or above) A Unit that hold this module can spend 4 charges and its bonus action to calculate an effective way to attack an enemy, providing that unit an advantage. User must do a Intelligent or Wisdom check against the target DC. This advantage will last until the start of this unit next turn.
## Heightened and Sharing Senses (Passive)
(M3 or above) A Unit that hold this module is automatically share information and advantage that was caused by information to any Unit that they choice in 30 feet radius of the holder. 
## Reactive Senses (3 Charges)
(M4 only) A unit that hold this module can reactively warn other about incoming damage. Holder can spend 3 charges and use its reaction to give 4 Unit (including themselves) advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that Unit can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.


# Entropy Module (M4)
Entropy Modules is a sub category of modules a Unit can get. These modules are used for takes control of Entropy.
## Maintain Energy (Passive)
A Unit that hold this module become unaffected to another Entropy effect from another Unit. 
## Surge of Energy (7 charges)
A unit that hold this module can absorb energy from its surrounding and granting the unit Haste effect. Each unit in the 15 feet radius of the holder must make a `DC 8 + Module Level + Unit's Level`. On a failed save the unit suffer 2d6 cold damage, and half damage on a successful save.

If the unit decided to absorb another unit's energy, the targeted unit must make a `DC 8 + Module Level + Unit's Level` Constitution Saving throw. On a failed save the targeted Unit take 8d6 cold damage and got slowed, or half damage on successful save instead. 

The slow and haste last for 1 minutes. The slowed unit make another Constitution Saving Throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save the effect end for it. 
## Thermal Regulation (2 charges)
As an action unit that hold this module can absorb 3d8 point of energy from its surrounding and can burst the energy. Each unit in 15 foot radius cone must make [DC 8 + Module Level + Unit's Level] Dexterity saving throw. An unit energy then absorbed and takes that many as a cold damage or half as much on a successful one. 

A unit that hold this module then can store that many of energy and as a bonus action can burst that energy into 15-foot radius cone. Each unit in its area must make another Dexterity saving throw. An unit takes that many as a fire damage or half as much on a successful one

# Gravitation Module (M2)
Gravitation Module is a sub category of modules a Unit can use. This module allow its user to control gravitation and it weight.
## Increase/Decrease Object Weight 
Holder of this module can spend 3 charges and use its action increase or decrease an object they see in 30 feet. The object size and weight
