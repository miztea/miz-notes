Rogue unit is a [[Unit]] that have an error in their system and have a some sort of error. This error might be a result from a rare code error in their system, an interference from outside, and a deliberate act to against unit's Code.

# Degree of Error
Units occasionally encounter errors in their code, which can usually be resolved using standard safety measures. However, some errors persist and alter the unit's operational behavior. These errors can accumulate up to 7 or, in extremely rare cases, up to 8. During ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, units roll 2 dice based on the Degree of Error's Table below. They add the first roll to the d20 roll and subtract with the second roll.`d20 roll + 1dn - 1dn`

| Degree of Error (n) | Dice (dn) |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| 1                   | d2        |
| 2                   | d4        |
| 3                   | d6        |
| 4                   | d8        |
| 5                   | d10       |
| 6                   | d12       |
| 7                   | d20       |
| 8                   | d100      |
