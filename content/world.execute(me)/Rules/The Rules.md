# Body & Core System
The unit comprises three main components: Armor, Inner Bodies, and Core, each with distinct functions. Their HP is divided as follows: 40% for Armor, 30% for Inner Bodies, and 30% for Core (unless specified otherwise).

- Armor provides resistance to non-magical physical damage and determines the unit's AC. Depletion of Armor HP results in the loss of AC and resistance.
- Inner Bodies, positioned beneath the armor, shield the core. Depletion of Inner Bodies' HP renders the unit unconscious. However, if the Inner Bodies' HP drops to zero, the unit can sacrifice a portion of its core HP to recover. The unit rolls a hit dice for 5% of its Core's HP, with each 5% loss causing the unit to suffer 1 exhaustion point.
- The core serves as the unit's energy source, and its destruction marks the end of the unit. However, a unit can be revived if its core is replaced with a new and identical one. If the core remains undamaged, it can also be jump-started using the appropriate tool.

# Rogue Unit
Rogue unit is a [[Unit]] that have an error in their system and have a some sort of error. This error might be a result from a rare code error in their system, an interference from outside, and a deliberate act to against unit's Code.

## Degree of Error
Units occasionally encounter errors in their code, which can usually be resolved using standard safety measures. However, some errors persist and alter the unit's operational behavior. These errors can accumulate up to 7 or, in extremely rare cases, up to 8. During ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, units roll 2 dice based on the Degree of Error's Table below. They add the first roll to the d20 roll and subtract with the second roll.`d20 roll + 1dn - 1dn`

| Degree of Error (n) | Dice (dn) |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| 1                   | d2        |
| 2                   | d4        |
| 3                   | d6        |
| 4                   | d8        |
| 5                   | d10       |
| 6                   | d12       |
| 7                   | d20       |
| 8                   | d100      |

This error can only be reduced with any repair module. 

# Vulnerable Point
Every unit possesses a vulnerable point, counted as part of the unit but with separate AC and HP (unless stated otherwise). Destroying this vulnerable point alters the unit's behavior. Players can perform an Intelligent (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to discern the location of the vulnerable point

# Resonance Event
Occasionally, conscious units become overwhelmed with emotion and enter into resonance with [[The Structure]]. This resonance may grant the unit partial control over the surrounding infrastructure and imbue it with additional power. However, this resonance also results in the unit losing cognitive abilities and acting solely on emotions aligned with [[The Structure]].
