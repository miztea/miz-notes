# Body & Core System
The bodies that the unit possesses have different segment and usage. Usually unit have 3 different body's part: The Armor, Inner Bodies, Core. Their HP is divided into 3 part; 40% for the armor, 30% for the inner bodies, 30% Core (unless otherwise is stated).
- Armor have resistance to non-magical physical damage and the Unit's AC. If the Armor's HP is depleted the Unit lose the AC and resistance.
- Inner Bodies are the part that below the armor and hold protection for the core. If the Inner Bodies' HP is depleted the Unit drop unconscious. 
- Core are the source of all Unit's energy. Unit will die if the core is destroyed.
