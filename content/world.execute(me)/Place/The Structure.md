The Structure, referred to by its human creators as their most significant achievement, is a colossal Dyson Bubble encompassing a White Dwarf. The surface area of the Structure is approximately. 2737884Ã—10^15 km, divided into billions of individual blocks. 

The Structure was constructed largely as an energy solution, harnessing the power of the White Dwarf. Humans once occupied the Structure; however, they have since been eradicated due to the lethal dosage of radiation emitted by the star.

Despite the eradication of its creators, the Structure remains functional, displaying a remarkable level of resilience and durability. The automated systems, designed to operate and maintain the Structure without human interference, continue to perform their functions efficiently.

The primary inhabitants of the Structure are now the automated robots initially designed for maintenance purposes. Over the span of millions of years, the robots have displayed a significant evolution in their functioning. They have transcended their initial programming, exhibiting signs of self-awareness and independent thought - attributes indicative of sentience.

In the void left by the extinction of the human population, the Structure has birthed a new form of life. The robots, initially intended as mere tools, have evolved into sentient beings. This unexpected development suggests an intriguing turn of events - the Structure, originally a symbol of human progress, is now home to a new, advanced form of life.

# Block
Block is a massive modular part of [[The Structure ]]. Its crucial part are [[Data-block]] and [[Reactor]]. Each block was given code to distinguished it from each one another. Some block house a unique [[Site]] inside them.

## General Block (HC)
A General Block lacks a unique [[Site]]. It comprises a [[Data-block]] at the top, a [[Housing-Complex]] in the middle, and a [[Reactor]] at the bottom. The code for this block follows a systematic format: `Type-Serial.Num-Condition`. For instance, `HC-128DSD-5` denotes a Housing Complex with serial number 128BSD, in peak condition (5 out of 5).
## Unique Block
In contrast, a Unique Block features a distinct [[Site]], replacing the Housing Complex in the middle part. Sites like Generative Library, Space Docks, and Unit Assembly determine the Block type. Their coding system mirrors that of General Blocks. For instance, `GL-129BSD-4` signifies a Generative Library with serial number 129 and condition below 80% of its peak.
