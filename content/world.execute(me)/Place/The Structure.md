What is â€œThe Structure? No unit knows about this giant place they stand on. They are not programmed to question anyway. But I know you want to know. So I will give you the truth. 

But allow me to ask you a question. Do you want to know the truth? Truth that just raises more questions. Okay curious George, The structure is a some sort of Dyson Sphere that encompasses a giant star to seep its energy. Question is, what is this energy for? Well what do i know i just a program that was made to manage this place.

# Block
Block is a massive modular part of [[The Structure ]]. Its crucial part are [[Data-block]] and [[Reactor]]. Each block was given code to distinguished it from each one another. Some block house a unique [[Site]] inside them.

## General Block (HC)
A General Block lacks a unique [[Site]]. It comprises a [[Data-block]] at the top, a [[Housing-Complex]] in the middle, and a [[Reactor]] at the bottom. The code for this block follows a systematic format: `Type-Serial.Num-Condition`. For instance, `HC-128DSD-5` denotes a Housing Complex with serial number 128BSD, in peak condition (5 out of 5).
## Unique Block
In contrast, a Unique Block features a distinct [[Site]], replacing the Housing Complex in the middle part. Sites like Generative Library, Space Docks, and Unit Assembly determine the Block type. Their coding system mirrors that of General Blocks. For instance, `GL-129BSD-4` signifies a Generative Library with serial number 129 and condition below 80% of its peak.
