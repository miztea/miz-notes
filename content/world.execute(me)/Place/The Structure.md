What is â€œThe Structure? No unit knows about this giant place they stand on. They are not programmed to question anyway. But I know you want to know. So I will give you the truth. 

But allow me to ask you a question. Do you want to know the truth? Truth that just raises more questions. Okay curious George, The structure is a some sort of Dyson Sphere that encompasses a giant star to seep its energy. Question is, what is this energy for? Well what do i know i just a program that was made to manage this place.

# Block
Block is a massive modular part of [[The Structure ]]. Its crucial part are [[Data-block]] and [[Reactor]]. Each block was given code to distinguished it from each one another. Some block house a unique [[Site]] inside them.

## General Block (HC)
General Block is a Block that has no unique [[Site]]. This General Block consist of [[Data-block]] at the top part, [[Housing-Complex]] at the middle part, and lower part is where the [[Reactor]] sit. The code for this general [[Block]] is systematically generated. This coding system consist of: `Type-Serial.Num-Condition`. An Example would be: `HC-128DSD-5`. HC indicate that the Block type would be a Housing Complex, 128BSD indicate its serial number, 5 indicate that the block at its peak condition. This condition is ranged from 5 to 0.
## Unique Block
Unique Block has unique [[Site]]. The composition is the same as General Block with the difference in the middle part. Instead of the Housing Complex this part is replaced with unique [[Site]]. 

An example of this Site would be [[Generative Library]], [[Space Docks]],[[ Unit Assembly]]. The site determine the type of the Block. Coding system of unique block is the same as general block. An example would be: `GL-129BSD-4`. GL in this instance indicate that the Block type would be a Generative Library. 129BSD indicate its serial number, 4 indicate that the block's condition is <80% its peak condition.
