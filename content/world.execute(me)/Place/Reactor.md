Reactor that power entire [[The Structure#Block]], drawn from decaying star below. Powering up each block. The technology behind it is controlling the energy (with entropy module) and focusing it to the energy panel. This energy then turned into electricity. This electricity is then distributed around the  [[The Structure#Block]].
